 *  Haunted House
 *  
 *  A silly, simple game in which you enter a haunted house with 3 treats.
 *  You meet ghosts along the way and gain 1 courage each time you give a 
 *  ghost a treat. Each time you encounter a ghost and don't have a treat,
 *  you can backtrack or keep going, but lose 1 courage.
 *  
 *  When you enter rooms, sometimes you will find a ghost, sometimes a treat,
 *  sometimes a trick, and sometimes nothing. If you find a treat,  
 *  you gain 1 treat if you have inventory space. If you find a trick, 
 *  you lose 1 courage if you have any. You cannot get negative courage.
 *  
 *  Each time you enter a room, the room tile becomes the player tile.
 *  You can switch between two tiles all game (or 1 plus number of players).
 *  
 *  To denote a player tile, triple click any tile on the tableau. 
 *  You can have (number of blinks - 1) players in theory, but the game is 
 *  designed for 6 *(1 + number of players) blinks.
