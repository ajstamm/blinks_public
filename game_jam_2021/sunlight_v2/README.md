# Perennial Garden

This game is more simulation than game. It runs on a series of blinks. To install it, you need blank blink to load it onto.

At the beginning, all tiles are yellowish or white. These tiles fade and grow brighter on a four-second loop to simulate the sun rising and setting. They grow whiter and yellower on a variable 7.8-to-16 second loop to simulate a summer to winter season. 

Click anywhere to add water to a tile. That tile will become green with a blue dot on one pip to denote that it is a water tile. The blue dot will become lighter and darker on a variable 5.6-to-8.0 second loop to simulate a water table that ebbs and flows on a monthly cycle. When the water level is high enough, the tile will begin to grow flowers during the day, even sometimes in winter. The flowers will fade or close again as the sun sets. 

The water tile will also share water with its neighbors, but these neighbors will not get blue pips. If the neighbors have enough water and sunlight, they will begin growing flowers, too. 

You can water more than one tile. For best results, use a greater numbers of blinks and water at least two tiles near an edge or corner. See images in this folder for example tableaus with 18 and 30 blinks. This simulation can run with as few as one blink, but it is less interesting at lower numbers.
