# Sunlight: perrenials

This is more a simulation than a game. 

It begins with all tiles a yellowish  to white color. These tiles fade and grow brighter on a variable 3-to-5 second loop to simulate the sun rising and setting. They grow whiter and yellower on a variable 8.2-to-60 second loop to simulate a summer to winter season. 

Click anywhere to add water to a tile. That tile will become green with a blue dot on one pip. The blue dot will become lighter and darker on a variable 6.3-to-20 second loop to simulate changing tides or water table. When the water level is high enough, it will begin to grow flowers when the sun is brightest, even in winter. The flowers will fade again as the sun sets. 

The water tile will also share water with its neighbors, but these neighbors will not get blue pips. If the neighbors have enough water and sunlight, they will begin growing flowers, too. 

You can water more than one tile. For best results, use a greater numbers of blinks and water at least two tiles near an edge or corner.
