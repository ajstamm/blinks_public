# Sunlight
# growing flowers

This is more a simulation than a game. It works best with greater numbers of blinks. 

It begins with all tiles a yellowish color, which fades and grows brighter to simulate the sun rising and setting. Click anywhere to add water to a tile. That tile will become green and begin to grow flowers when the sun is brightest. The flowers will fade agin as the sun sets. It will also share water with its neighbors. If the neighbors have enough water, they will begin growing flowers, too. You can water more than one tile.
